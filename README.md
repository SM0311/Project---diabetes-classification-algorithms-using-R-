# Project---diabetes-classification-algorithms-using-R-
Diabetes Classification Using Various Algorithms  This project aims to classify whether a patient has diabetes using a dataset with various features. I employ multiple classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Tree, and Random Forest to achieve this goal.
