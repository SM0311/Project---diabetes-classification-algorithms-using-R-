# Project---diabetes-classification-algorithms-using-R-
Diabetes Classification Using Various Algorithms  This project aims to classify whether a patient has diabetes using a dataset with various features. I employ multiple classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Tree, and Random Forest to achieve this goal. 

# App for Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a Shiny application designed for predicting diabetes outcomes based on user input data. The app features: https://surajm0311.shinyapps.io/DiabetesClassificationWebApp/

- **User Input**:
  
Pregnancies:

Type: Integer
Description: Number of pregnancies the individual has had.
Glucose:

Type: Integer
Description: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure:

Type: Integer
Description: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness:

Type: Integer
Description: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
Insulin:

Type: Integer
Description: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI:

Type: Numeric
Description: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction:

Type: Numeric
Description: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age:

Type: Integer
Description: Age of the individual.
# Outcome:
Type: Integer
Description: Diabetes outcome (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).

- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to provide predictions.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualizations to help interpret the results.
- **Model Evaluation**: Displays performance metrics of the prediction model.

The app is intended to provide an interactive experience for understanding diabetes risk factors and predictions.
